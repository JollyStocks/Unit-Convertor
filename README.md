# Unit-Convertor
This desktop application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to convert values between different units of measurement. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) with dropdown menus and entry fields for user-friendly interaction.

# How to Use 
1. Open the program
   
   Just run the Python script. A window with the title “Unit Convertor” will pop up.

3. Choose your “From” unit
   At the top section, there’s a box to type in your number and a dropdown beside it.
   Click the dropdown to pick the unit you want to convert from — like meters or kilometers.

4. Type the number to convert
   Type the value into the top input box. For example, type 1000.

5. Choose your “To” unit
   Scroll down a bit. There’s another dropdown for the unit you want to convert to. Pick something like centimeters or micrometers.

6. See the result instantly
   Once both units are selected and you typed in a number, the result will show up automatically in the second box below.

7. You can also convert the other way around
   If you type in the bottom box instead, the top box will convert based on that. So it works both ways.
